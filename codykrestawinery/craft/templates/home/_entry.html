 # Home entry template

 # This template gets loaded whenever a Home entry’s URL is
 # requested. That’s because the ourHome section’s Template setting is
 # set to home/_entry”, the path to this template.
 #
 # When this template is loaded, it will already have an ‘entry’
 # variable, set to the requested ourHome entry.
